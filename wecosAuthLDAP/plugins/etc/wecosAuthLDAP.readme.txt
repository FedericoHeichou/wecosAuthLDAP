README for Wecos Auth LDAP Login
--------------------------------

This plugin offers the possibility to replace the standard (local) login with LDAP. Here the plugin offers the option to keep the local login as fallback - hoping not to lock itself out after installation. In this respect, here briefly the usual procedure for the installation:

- Login to your Revive adserver as an administrator
- Change to the administration if you are not already there (Working as "Administrator Account")
- Go to the Configuration -> Plugins menu
- disable the option "Enable newly installed plugins" to be on the safe side
- Now install the plugin "wecosAuthLDAP" in the plugins.
- Click on "Details" of the plugin wecosAuthLDAP, and there first on the settings of the "LDAP Authentication Plugin".
- Enter your LDAP server settings there.
- DONT check "LDAP Authentication only (fallback to OpenX database otherwise)" at this time
- now switch to the settings of the second plugin part (LDAP Login Test Plugin) and activate "Enable LDAP Authentication Testpage". This activates a new menu item "LDAP Testpage" in the main menu.
- Now go to the new menu item "LDAP Testpage", here you can test if it is possible for the plugin to authenticate against the LDAP server from your configuration. If not, with a bit of luck there will be a halfway meaningful error message on the page, with which you can contact the developer of the plugin.
- If the login test was successful, switch back to the plugin configuration and deactivate the LDAP test login option (the new menu item should disappear).
- Now you are free to activate the option "LDAP Authentication ony", this should now be possible without any risk.

Please note: The accounts must still be created on the Revive ad server as usual, only the password verification takes place via the LDAP server.
