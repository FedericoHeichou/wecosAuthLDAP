README for Wecos Auth LDAP Login
--------------------------------

This plugin offers the possibility to replace the standard (local) login with LDAP. There is an option to fallback to local authentication - hoping not to lock itself out after installation. In this respect, here briefly the usual procedure for the installation:

* Login to your Revive adserver as an administrator
* Change to the administration if you are not already there (Working as "Administrator Accountâ€œ)
* Go to the Configuration -\> Plugins menu
* Install the plugin "wecosAuthLDAP" in the plugins.
* Click on "Details" of the plugin wecosAuthLDAP, and there first on the settings of the "LDAP Authentication Plugin".
* Enter your LDAP server settings there.
* DONT check "LDAP Authentication only (plugin will not fallback to Revive database otherwise)" at this time
* Enable the plugin
* switch to the settings of the second plugin part (LDAP Login Test Plugin) and activate "Enable LDAP Authentication Testpage". This activates a new menu item "LDAP Testpage" in the main menu.
* Navigate to that testpage, try to test login (testpage wont use fallback). If the login test was successful, switch back to the plugin configuration and deactivate the LDAP test login option (the new menu item should disappear).
* Feel free to activate the option "LDAP Authentication ony", this should now be possible without any risk.
* Navigate to "Configuration -\> User Interface Settings, change "Authentication mechanism" from internal to wecosAuthLDAP and "save".

Please note: The accounts must still be created on the Revive ad server as usual, only the password verification takes place via the LDAP server.
